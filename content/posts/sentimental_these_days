Lecently I have more and more sentimental these days.

<!--more-->

When I remember my parents, I more sentimental.
My parent are old. and getting older.

That makes me sad. and more sad as times goes by.

When I young, I don't care about life and family (parent, brothers, etc)
That's stupid.

Old saying are right. but I don't understand when I young.

I dont know sentimental emotion as I get older.

But time to time. I feel crying.
crying.. cry. so sad.
